#example of IF block, as we said before, indentation is important
if True:
    print('Hello')
    a = 5
    print(a)

#otherwise, remember that we can write multiple statements in one line using ;
#so, the prior example can be rewriten as follow (not recommended):
if True: print('Hello'); a = 5; print(a)
